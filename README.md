# Recipe Full Stack with BAAS (Backend As A Service) - Appwrite

The goal :

- Create a nice and beautiful (Tailwind) React app that demands the user to be logged in to create recipes in their profile.

- Use the authentication system of Appwrite to perform the register/login. (email is the simplest one, but it would be awesome to give the possibility to login with Gmail or another service)

- Use the database model of Appwrite to store the recipes

- Use the bucket system of Appwrite to upload a cover picture of the recipe.

- For the recipes :
- An upload field for the cover picture
- A field for the title
- A field for a description
- Several fields (that can be added) for the ingredients with quantity and name.

- When a recipe is created, you should see it in your dashboard. And you also will have to implement logic in order to chose for how many people you want the quantity of the ingredients to be.
